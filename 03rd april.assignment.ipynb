    "Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm, which means it can only classify instances into two classes. However, it can be extended to handle multiclass classification problems using two common techniques: one-vs-all (OVA) and softmax regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the OVA approach, a separate binary logistic regression model is trained for each class. During training, one class is treated as the positive class and all other classes are treated as the negative class. For example, in a problem with four classes (A, B, C, and D), four separate binary logistic regression models are trained: one to distinguish class A from classes B, C, and D; another to distinguish class B from classes A, C, and D; and so on. During prediction, the model with the highest predicted probability is chosen as the output.\n",

    "In softmax regression, a single model is trained to predict the probabilities of each class. The model uses the softmax function, which generalizes the logistic function to handle more than two classes. The softmax function outputs a probability distribution over all the classes, with each probability representing the likelihood of the instance belonging to that class. During prediction, the class with the highest probability is chosen as the output.\n",

    "Both OVA and softmax regression are common techniques for using logistic regression for multiclass classification. However, softmax regression is preferred when the classes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning each instance can belong to only one class.
