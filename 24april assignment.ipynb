    "In the context of principal component analysis(PCA) , a projection is a transformation of the data from its original high-dimensional space to a new, lower-dimesional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA can be thought of as projection method where data with m-columns(features) is projected into a subspace with m or fewer columns, while retaining the essence of the original data. The goal of PCA is to find the directions(or vectors) in the original data. The goal of PCA is to find the directions(or vectors) in the high-dimensioal space along which the variation  in the data is maximized. These directions are called principal components, and they are used to project the data from its original space to a new space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first principal component is the direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The second principal component is orthogonal (at right angles) to the first and maximizes the remaining variance , and so on for subsequent components.\n",

    "However, there is no  general method that works in every situation  for choosing the optimal number of principal components. It depends on the reason behind conducting the PCA and the priorities of the user. If the aim is to visualize the data in a more interpretable way, one can conduct a PCA and select the first two or three principal components for visualization. If the aim is to reduce the number of features in the dataset, one can set a threshold for explained variance or use cross-validation to determine the optimal number of principal components.\n",

    "Choosing too few principal components can result in loss of important information and lead to proper model performance. On the other , choosing too many principal components can result in retaining noise and redundancy in the data, which can also negatively impact model performance.  \n",
