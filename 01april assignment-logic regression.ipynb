Both types of regularization can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.

Oversampling can be done by duplicating the minority class samples or by generating synthetic samples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Undersampling can be done by randomly removing samples from the majority class. Resampling can help balance the classes and improve the model's performance.\n",

Bagging involves training multiple logistic regression models on different subsets of the data and combining their predictions. Boosting involves iteratively training logistic regression models on the misclassified samples from the previous iteration.\n",

One way to address this is by using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, which penalize large coefficients and prevent overfitting.\n",

    "Multicollinearity: Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictors are highly correlated with each other, which can result in unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates. One way to address this is by using feature selection techniques to identify and remove the redundant features, or by using dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to transform the correlated features into a smaller set of uncorrelated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing Data: Missing data can reduce the sample size and bias the results of the analysis. One way to address this is by using imputation techniques such as mean imputation or regression imputation to replace the missing values with estimated values based on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Imbalance: Class imbalance occurs when one class has significantly more samples than the other, which can result in biased predictions towards the majority class. One way to address this is by using resampling techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to balance the classes, or by using cost-sensitive learning techniques to assign different costs to misclassifications of the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-linearity: Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the log-odds of the outcome. If this assumption is violated, the model may not fit the data well. One way to address this is by using polynomial terms or interactions between the predictors to capture the non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers: Outliers can have a disproportionate impact on the logistic regression model, leading to biased estimates. One way to address this is by using robust regression techniques such as M-estimation or Huber regression, which are less sensitive to outliers than ordinary least squares regression.\n",
