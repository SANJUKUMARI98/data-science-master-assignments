    "In ensemble technique in machine learning,we combine different  model and train it with the sample data. This is called bagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): The primary goal of \"bagging\" or \"bootstrap aggregating\" ensemble method is to minimize variance errors in decision trees. The objective here is to randomly create samples of training datasets with replacement (subsets of the training data). The subsets are then used for training decision trees or models. Consequently, there is a combination of multiple models, which reduces variance, as the average prediction generated from different models is much more reliable and robust than a single model or a decision tree."

    "Bootstrap is a resampling method that is used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic from a sample. The basic idea behind bootstrap is to repeatedly sample from the original data set to create new, simulated data sets, and then use these simulated data sets to estimate the statistic of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved in bootstrap are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a random sample of size n from the original data set.\n",
    "Using this sample, calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., the mean, median, variance, etc.).\n",

    "Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the bootstrap statistics.\n",
    "Construct the confidence interval for the statistic of interest by finding the appropriate percentiles of the bootstrap distribution.\n",
    "The bootstrap method works because the repeated sampling from the original data set allows us to estimate the variability of the statistic of interest without making assumptions about the distribution of the population. By using the simulated data sets, we can estimate the sampling distribution of the statistic of interest, which in turn allows us to estimate the standard error and construct confidence intervals.\n",

    "Bootstrap is a powerful and flexible method that can be applied to a wide range of statistical problems. It is especially useful when the sample size is small or when the data do not follow a known distribution. However, it is important to remember that bootstrap is not a substitute for good study design or proper statistical analysis."
