    "\n",
    "REST(representational state transfer) and SOAP(simple access protocol) are two popular architectural styles for designing web services. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) as the underlying protocol for communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "it is based on the principles of a stateless, client-server communication   model,where the server exposes a set of resources tht can be accessed and manipulated by clients using standard  HTTP methods such as GET,POST,PUT and DELETE. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs (application programming  interfaces) are designed around resources, which are identified by URIs (Uniform resource identifiers). Clients can interact with these resources by making \n",

    "\n",
    "REST is lightweight and simple to implement , making it widely adopted in weh services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "shortcomings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lack of standardization : REST does not enforce a strict standard for message formats or protocols, leadinig to inconsistencies and variations in the implementation of APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Lack of formal contract : REST APIs do not have a formal contract definition, making it challenging to ensure interoperability an discoverability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Limited functionality : REST is primarily designed for CRUD(create,read,update, and delete) operations and may not provide robust support for more complex operations or workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Overfetching and underfetching : REST APIs often suffer from overfetching or underfetching of data, meaning the client may receive more or less data than it actually needs, resulting inefficient network usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. coupling to HTTP : REST tightly couples the API design to HTTP protocol , making it less flexible  when working with non- HTTP protocols or in scenarios where HTTP may not be the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# SOAP :\n",
    "\n",
    "it is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services using XML(extensible markup language);it defines a set of rules for constructing messages,specifying message formats, protocols, and a standardized way to represenet data types and procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "soap based web services typically use XMl-based soap envelopes to wrap the request and response message, which are sent over various protocols such as HTTP,SMTP,or JMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP provides a more formal contract through WSDL(web services description language),which describes the service's interface ,operations and message formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "shortcoming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 complexity : SOAP is more complex compared to REST ,as involves XML parsing , complex message structures, and additional layers of protocols. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. overhead : SOAP message tend to be layer due to XML format , which result in increased network bandwidth consumption and slower transmission times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.performance : The additional processing required for parsing XML and handling SOAP  envelopes can impact performance, especially in high-volume  fo latency-sensitive scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tight coupling : SOAP can lead to tight coupling between the client and the server, as it relies on the WSDL contract for communication. Any changes to the contract require updates on both the client and server sides.\n",
