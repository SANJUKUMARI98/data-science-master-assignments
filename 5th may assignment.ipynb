    "Time-dependent seasonal components  in time series data represent recurring patterns or fluctuations that follow regular cylces(e.g. daily,monthly , or yearly), but with a crucial twist : these patterns evolve and change over the time. In other words, while seasonality is a common feature of time series data, the characteristics of these seasonal patterns are not fixed, they are influenced by external factors and undergo modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recurring Patterns : Seasonal components involves predictable variations that repeat at consistent intervals. For example , retail sales may peak during the holiday season every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variability Over Time : Time - dependent seasonality implies that the strength, duration, or timing of these seasonal patterns shift as external conditions changes. This can result from evolving consumer preferences , economic shifts, or other external influences. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Challenges : Identifying and modelling time-dependent seasonality can be more complex than modelling fixed seasonality. Traditional modelsl may struggle to capture these changing patterns effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced Modelling : Analysts often turn to advanced modelling techniques, such as state-space modelsl or Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, to account for time- dependent seasonality. These models adapt to evolving seasonal patterns and provide more accurate forecasts.\n",

    "Identifying time - dependent seasonal components in time series data involves a combination of visual inspection, statistical test , and model diagonstics.steps are : \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visual Inspection : Begin by plotting the time series data, including the trend and seasonal components, over the entire dataset. Look for recurring patterns  that might exhibit variations over the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Seasonal Decomposition : Use a seasonal decomposition techniques like STL (seasonal -trend decomposition using LOESS) or Classical decomposition to separate the time series into trend, seasonal  and residual components. Observe whether the seasonal component varies over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Autocorrelation Analysis : Calculate autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions for various lags. If the seasonal component changes over time , you observe varying autocorrelation patterns at different lags. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Time Plots : Create time plots of the seasonal component extracted from the decomposition . Observe whether the amplitude or frequency of the seasonal cycles changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Statistical Test  : Apply statistical test like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller(ADF) test to assess the stationarity of the seasonal component . Non-stationarity may indicate time- dependent seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Model Residuals : If you fit a seasonal model (e.g. SARIMA) to the data, examine the residuals for any remaining seasonality domain knowledge to understand potential reason for time-dependent seasonality, such as economic factors or external events. \n",

Selecting the appropriate order is a crucial step, oftern determined through statistical techniques like autocorrelation plots and information criteria ex. AIC, BIC.\n",

    "\n",
    "ans\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To use autoregression(AR) models for predicting future time points in a time series, follow these steps : \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model Estimation : First, select an appropriate oreder(p) for th AR model, representing the number of past time points that will be used to predict future  values. This choice is often determined through model selection techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parameter Estimation : Use historical data to estimate the coefficients(phi_1, phi_2,...phi_p) of the AR model. This involves fitting the model to the data, typically through least squares estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Forecasting : Once the model is trained and the coefficients are estimated , you can make predictions for future time points. To predict the value at time t+1 , you use the observed values at time t, t-1,...t-p  as inputs and apply the model coefficients. \n",

    "Forecast at t+1  = phi_1 * X_t +phi_2 * X_(t-1) + ....+ phi_p * X_(t-p)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Nature of Modelling : MA models capture short-term dependencies in the data by modelling the relationship between the current observation and past forecast errors. This differs from Autogressive(AR) models, which model the relationship between the current observation and past values of the time series itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Forecast Error Component : In an MA model, the forecast at a given time point is a weighted sum of past forecast errors. This reflects the idea that unexpected shocks in the past can influence future values. AR models , on the other hand, use  past values of the time series for forecasting . \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parameter Estimation : MA models involve estimating the model's order(q), which determines the numbers of past forecast errors to include . This order selection process distinguishes  MA models  from AR models, where the order represents the number of past values to include.\n",

    "3. Mixed Modelling : The key distinction is that an ARMA model combines both AR and MA components in a single model. The parameters of the AR and MA components, represented as p and q , respectively, are estimated simultaneously . this allows the model to capture both the autoregressive and moving average dependencies  in the data. \n",

Versatility : ARMA models are more versatile than standalone AR or MA models because they can handle a wider range of time series patterns by incorporating both short-term and long -term dependencies.
