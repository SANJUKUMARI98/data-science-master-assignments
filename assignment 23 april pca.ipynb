    "As the no. of features or dimensions increase in dataset , the model performance degraded due to heavy internal mathematical calculatioons.\n",
    "It is important in machine learning because it leads to poor model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The curse of dimensionality is a common problem in machine learning, where the performance of the model deteriorates as the number of features increases because the complexity of the model increases with number of features , and it becomes more difficult to find a good solution. In addition, high-dimensional data can also lead to overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and does not generalize well to new data. Dimensionality reduction can help to mitigate these problems by reducing the complexity of the model and improving its generalization performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variable in a dataset.More input features often make a predictive modelling task more challenging to model, more generally referred to as  the curse of dimensionality. High-dimensionality statistics and dimensionality reduction techniques are often used for data visualization . Nevertheless, these techniques can be used in applied machine learning  to simplify a classification  or regression dataset in order to better fit a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches to dimensionality reduction:\n",
    "1. Feature selection : Which involves selecting a subset of the original features that are most relevant to the problem at hand. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature extraction : involves creating new features by combining or transforming the original features. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, dimensionality reduction  is important in machine learning because it can help improve the performance of the models by reducing their complexity and  mitigating issues such as overfitting . It can also make it easier to visualize high - dimensional data and gain insights from it. There are several techniques for achieving dimensionality reduction, including feature selection and feature extraction."
