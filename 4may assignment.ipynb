    "Answer \n",
    "\n",
    "ARIMA(Autogregressive Integrated Moving Average ) is a popular time series modelling techniques used to forecast future values of a time series. ARIMA models are based on the assumptions that the past values of a time series can be used to predict its future values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIMA models have three components: autoregression(AR) , differencing(I), and moving average(MA). The AR component represents the relationship between the current value of the time series and its past values, while the MA component represents the relationship between the current value of the time series and its past forecast errors. The I component represents the order of differencing required to make the time series stationary(i.e., removing any trend or seasonality).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply ARIMA modelling to forecast time series data, the first step is to determine the appropriate values for AR, I, MA components. This can be done using a method called parameter estimation , which involves fitting a series of models with different parameter values to the data and selecting the model with the best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the  model parameters have been determined , the next step is to the model to make forecasets. This involves  feeding the historical data into the model and using it to generate a forecast for future values of the time series. The accuracy of the forecast can be evaluated using various metrics , such as mean squared error or mean absolute error."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited explanatory power : Time series analysis is primarily focused on forecasting future values of a variable based on its past values. While this can be useful for predictin, it may not provide a complete understanding of the underlying causes of the observed patterns. \n",

    "- Assumption of stationarity : Many time series models assume that the underlying data is stationary , meaning that its statistical properties do not change over the time. However , in practice , many real -world time series exhibit non-stationarity, which can make it difficult to apply these models.\n",

Financial data oftern exhibits complex and non-stationary patterns, such as sudden changes, in market conditions, long-term trends, and interactions betweeen multiple economic factors. These patterns can be difficult to model using traditional time series approaches and my require more advanced methods, such as machine learning algorithms, to capture the full complexity of the data. Additionally, financial data is often subject to external shocks and events, such as changes in government  policies or unexpected economic developments  , which can mame it challenging to accurately forecast future trends and make informed investment decisions."

In other words, it has constant mean, constant variance, and constant autocorrelation structure(the relationship between data points at different time lags reamins consistent).
